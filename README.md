# project-checkurl

This is a CLI Tool made in Node.js to take a file name as argument, then scan each valid URL found within the document for their availability.

Features:

2. Supports windows and unix arguments for version display.
3. Request timeout is set to 5 seconds to prevent program from freezing, other errors are catched and displayed back to the client.
